# R2-D2

An audio customization GUI created with [React.js](https://react.dev/) and [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/guide/)

## Tools
- React.js

- Framer motion
- Qwerty Hancock

## General Notes
> I thought of how cool it would be to make a visualiser but I wanted to know what audio was all about so I started this as a react application.
